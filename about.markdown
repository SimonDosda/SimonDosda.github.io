# Why, but Why this blog?

Hi everybody, my name is Simon and I became a web developer quite recently, after working several years on engine development in the automotive industry.

Since I have started working in web development, I have learned quite a bunch of useful things, and since my memory is not my best weapon, I have decided to write them down in a blog, and make them available to everybody.

I hope you will enjoy it!

  Hi! First of all, this is an amazing tutorial. Second, i have a problem. After
  pressing "Send" it goes to the staticman url on heroku but it gives me
  application error. The main page of the heroku app is alright (it shows
  welcome message from staticman). I think i followed everything right.

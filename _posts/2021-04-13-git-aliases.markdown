Git is one of the most important tools for any kind of development, as emphasized in this article, [New Developer? You shouldâ€™ve learned Git yesterday](https://codeburst.io/number-one-piece-of-advice-for-new-developers-ddd08abc8bfa), from *Brandon Morelli*.

In this article I am not going to talk about what git is and why it should be utilized, but how you can be more efficient using it thanks to git aliases. 

In the following sections, I go through the details of all my aliases, but if you are in a hurry you can go directly to the [last section](#summary) to have the complete list of them.

## Basic shortcuts

The first step of laziness. These aliases will just shorten the number of characters you type. The one I use the most is `co` for `checkout`. I have defined other ones but don't really use them ; I prefer their variants which I will present later. Meanwhile, here is a list of classic aliases that I configured.

```bash
co = checkout
br = branch
ci = commit
st = status</pre>
```

More interestingly, you can also use this kind of shortcut to create new commands. The two ones I use a lot are for branch management.

```bash
nb = checkout -b  # create a new branch
del = branch -D  # delete a branch
```

These allow you to create a new branch by typing `git nb <branch-name>` or to delete one by typing `git del <branch-name>`.

## Enhanced shortcuts

I personally find some default behaviors of git quite annoying. For instance, the fact that you need to set the name of the remote branch whereas I find it quite rare to have a situation where this name is different from your local branch.

To solve this I use an alias, `git p`, that pushes the branch while setting the upstream branch with the same name.

```bash
# push to the same branch name
p = !git push -u origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

Most of the time I also want to stage all my modifications, and of course add a message to my commit, so I use an alias allowing me to do `git c "<my-commit-message>"` that takes care of it. If I just want to commit a work in progress, I do `git wip`, and it commits everything with WIP as a message.

```bash
# stage and commit all the changes
c = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m 
# stage and commit all the changes with WIP as a commit message
wip = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m 'WIP'
```

Finally, there is no quick way to get rid of everything we have done. However, sometimes we just play around a bit with no compelling results. To do so I add a `git drop` alias. There are several ways to do this, in my case I just stash my changes and drop them.

```bash
drop = !git stash &amp;&amp; git stash drop  # drop current changes<
```
## Status helpers

I have a couple of aliases to give me some information about the current state of my repository. The first one is `git state`, which will fetch the remote repository (while removing deleted distant branches and fetching tags, some other default behaviors of git I don't understand), and then will display the branches status locally and on the server using the verbose mode.

The other, a simpler one, is `git ll <n>`. It lists the n last commits of the current branch on one line.

```bash
# give a quick look at the state of the repo
state = !git fetch --prune && git fetch --tags && clear && git branch -vv && git status
ll = !git log --oneline -n  # list the n last commits
```

## Rebasing helpers

My workflow with git is based on a clean history, with one and only one commit for each feature or fix of the application, and no merge commits. While this gives a very pleasant history, it also means using a lot of rebasing functionalities and a lot of force pushing.

To do so I have the forced version of the push presented before, `git fp`. I also have a command to amend everything in the current commit, `git amend`. The combination of those two is `git afp`, for **a**mend and **f**orce **p**ush, redoubtably efficient and dangerous, but I constantly use it!

```bash
# force push to the same branch name
fp = !git push origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) -f
# amend everything in the current commit
amend = !git add -A && git commit --amend --no-edit
# amend and force push
afp = !git amend && git fp
```

For the rebasing part, the main aliases I use are `git rom` (for **r**ebase **o**n **m**aster), which rebases the current branch on origin master (after fetching it), `git rh` (for **r**eset **h**ard), which can be seen as a force pull and resets the current branch with the remote one, and `git ri <n>`  (for **r**ebase **i**nteractive), which allows an interactive rebasing of the n last commits.

```bash
# rebase on origin/master
rom = !git fetch --all && git rebase origin/master
# reset the branch to the distant one
rh = !git fetch && git reset --hard origin/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
# interactive rebasing
ri = "!f() { git rebase -i HEAD~$1; }; f"
```

## <a name="summary"></a>But how do I set these aliases ?

You can set an alias with the config command of git, eg `git config --global alias.co checkout`, but the easiest is to write it directly in the `.gitconfig` file in your home directory, in the `[alias]` section.

Here is the list of all my aliases presented above (plus `git cp` which copies the current commit hash, handy for cherry-picking).

```bash
co = checkout
br = branch
ci = commit
st = status

nb = checkout -b  # create a new branch
del = branch -D  # delete a branch

# give a quick look at the state of the repo
state = !git fetch --prune &amp;&amp; git fetch --tags &amp;&amp; clear &amp;&amp; git branch -vv &amp;&amp; git status
ll = !git log --oneline -n  # list the n last commits

# stage and commit all the changes
c = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m   
# stage and commit all the changes with WIP as a commit message
wip = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m 'WIP'
drop = !git stash &amp;&amp; git stash drop  # drop current changes

# push to the same branch name
p = !git push -u origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
# force push to the same branch name
fp = !git push origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) -f
# amend everything in the current commit
amend = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit --amend --no-edit
# amend and force push
afp = !git amend &amp;&amp; git fp

# rebase on origin/master
rom = !git fetch --all &amp;&amp; git rebase origin/master
# reset the branch to the distant one
rh = !git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset --hard origin/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
# interactive rebasing
ri = "!f() { git rebase -i HEAD~$1; }; f"

# copy current hash in the clipboard 
cp = !git rev-parse HEAD | xargs echo -n  | xclip -selection clipboard 
```

If you often need to use several terminals, you probably have already felt the need to be able to manage them more easily.

I really believe that as one of our main tools, configuring the way we use the shell is of great benefit to developers.

This is why, following [my post on the z shell](https://simondosda.github.io/shell/tool/2021/04/20/enhance-shell-zsh.html), I want to share with you my setup to be able to transform the pain of launching and using multiple terminals into a much more enjoyable experience.

## Why use a terminal multiplexer ?

If you are a developer, the terminal is probably part of your tool belt. Unfortunately, the base terminal is a bit, well...limited.

Thankfully, there are several kinds of software that tackle this problem, allowing us to be able to group our shells, organize them and switch from one to another seamlessly.

These software products are divided in two categories, terminal emulators and terminal multiplexers. Let's have a look at the main differences between them.

### Mouse based Emulators

These programs will allow you to emulate several terminals in their window.

They are very easy to install and use. I call them mouse based because they allow you to carry out all their functions with a mouse, like resizing each terminal or adding a new tab.

It is a great and easy way to start using multiple terminals. The most famous one is [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and it is already installed on a lot of linux distros.

### Keyboard based Multiplexer

Contrary to emulators, multiplexers are not stand alone software but instead are launched in a terminal.

I call them keyboard based because it is the main way to use them, you might have some mouse support but it will be very light. Which means that there is a bit of a learning curve before being able to use them.

_So why should I bother?_

Please don’t leave yet! They do have several advantages over terminal emulators, how about we take a look at them and I let you decide if they fit your usage.

Since a terminal multiplexer lives in a terminal, it can be used everywhere you can open a terminal, say for example a remote server on which you log in through ssh.

It is is particularly useful as a terminal multiplexer opens a server that keeps your terminal in a session when you launch it. This allows you to connect to a remote server, enter some long-time running commands, disconnect from the server but still be able, when you log back, to reopen this session as it was.

It also means terminal multiplexers can be used to share a session with other users or with yourself; for example in order to have the same terminal displayed on several windows or workspaces on your computer.

Furthermore, customization capabilities are almost endless and allow you to really shape it to your needs.

Last but not least, you will eventually end up being much more efficient only using your keyboard.

The two main terminal multiplexers are [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) and [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux), which are very similar. _Tmux_ is a bit more recent and my object of focus in this post.

## How to install and use _tmux_ ?

Before being able to use _tmux_, you will need to install it, which should not be a headhache. On a Debian system it is done with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install _tmux_
```

Once _tmux_ is installed, you will be able to create a session.

But first, let me explain the lingo behind _tmux_ with this schema.

![2021-05-03-lingo.png](/assets/images/2021-05-03-lingo.png)

When you install _tmux_ it will launch a **server**.

This **server** will allow you to manage **sessions**, on one terminal you will be attached to one session.

Command `tmux` will start a new unnamed session whereas `tmux new -s <session-name>` allows you to begin a new session with the corresponding name. You can also rename it by typing `Ctrl-b + $`. You can detach from a session by typing `Ctrl-b + d`, see the sessions started with the command `tmux ls` and attach to one with the command `tmux attach -t <session-name>`.

Once you are in a session, you will be able to create several **windows** in it.

A **window** is displayed on the whole terminal window (hence the name) and can contain several **panes**.

Finally, a **pane** is what contains a terminal!

You can create a new **window** with the command `Ctrl-b + c`, go to the next one with `Ctrl-b + n` or to the previous one with `Ctrl-b + p`.

Then you have the liberty of creating and arranging as many panes as you see fit. Shortcuts for the panes are not very convenient (at least that’s my opinion) so I won’t put them here but I will show you how to configure them in the next section.

For all the main commands, you can use a _tmux_ cheat-sheet like the one at [tmuxcheatsheet.com](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/).

## Customizing _tmux_ to your needs

_Tmux_ offers a lot of customization: you can change all the key bindings, tune its appearance, add scripts,...

To do so, you just need to edit the configuration file at `~/tmux.config`.

### Changing the prefix

The first thing you might want to change is the prefix.

You probably noticed that all the shortcuts I gave you so far started with `Ctrl-b`, which is the default prefix for _tmux_, needed before any command.

You can change it to another letter (be careful that it doesn't collide with a system shortcut though) with the following lines (to change it to `Ctrl-a` here).

```bash
# remap prefix from Ctrl-b to Ctrl-a
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix
```

### Changing the split-window commands

Remember when I told you that the shortcuts for panes were not very convenient? Here is a good example with the split-window ones.

Splitting a window vertically is done with `prefix + "` and horizontally with `prefix + %`, which is not very easy to remember. A common change for these ones is to use more visual _bar_ keys, like `-` and `|`.

```bash
# split panes using | and -
bind-key | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind-key - split-window -v  -c "#{pane_current_path}"
unbind-key '"'
unbind-key %
```

Notice that I have also added the option `-c "#{pane_current_path}"`. This will use your current path when creating a new pane, instead of your home path.

### Adding switch panes shortcuts

For switching from one pane to another, using the prefix can be quite cumbersome. However, this is an action you want to seamlessly carry out.

What you can do is add _direct_ shortcuts, by direct I mean that you won’t need to type the prefix before.

This is done using the option `-n` for the `bind-key` command.

Personally, I add shortcuts that allow me to easily navigate between my panes using arrows or vim keys while holding the control key.

```bash
# switch panes using Ctrl + arrow without prefix
bind-key -n C-Left select-pane -L
bind-key -n C-Right select-pane -R
bind-key -n C-Up select-pane -U
bind-key -n C-Down select-pane -D
# switch panes using Ctrl + vim keys without prefix
bind-key -n C-h select-pane -L
bind-key -n C-l select-pane -R
bind-key -n C-k select-pane -U
bind-key -n C-j select-pane -D
# toggle zoom using Ctrl + z
bind-key -n C-z resize-pane -Z
```

That's much more efficient, the same can be done for navigating between windows.

```bash
# switch window using Ctrl + p/n without prefix
bind-key -n C-p previous-window
bind-key -n C-n next-window
```

### Copy/Paste with vi commands

_Tmux_ allow you to switch to a _copy mode_, in which you can scroll up through your terminal display, search for a specific text and copy a part of the text, among other features.

To switch to copy mode, simply type `prefix + [`. You can choose between 2 sets of command to navigate in copy mode, either using `vi` or `emacs` keys.

I am personally used to vi keys (as you might have noticed already!) so this is the one I use. I even enforce some commands to be closer to the vi ones.

```bash
# vi copy/paste mode
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send-keys -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
```

Once in copy mode, I can navigate the history using vi controls, start a selection with the `v` key, copy it with `y` ,and then paste it in your terminal using `prefix + ]`.

Very useful!

## Launching a predefined session quickly with _tmuxp_

Now that we have configured _tmux_ and are starting to be comfortable with all its commands, let me present you a tool that will dramatically reduce the time it takes you to setup your environment for a project.

This tool is a _tmux_ environment manager called _tmuxp_. Basically, it allows you to define your environments in files and then launch them for you, instead of creating custom new windows every time.

It is a python package and hence is installed using `pip`.

```bash
pip install tmuxp
```

You can then create _tmuxp_ environment files in _yaml_ and put them in the `~/.tmuxp` directory.

Let me show you how to do it with a commented example.

```yaml
# ~./tmuxp/advanced-react.yaml
session_name: advanced-react # name of the session
windows: # list all windows
  - window_name: backend # name of the window
    layout: even-vertical # how panes are displayed
    shell_command_before: # list of commands that will run in every panes
      - cd ~/Workspace/advanced-react/backend
    panes: # list of panes
      - shell_command: # list of commands for the pane
          - npm run dev
      - shell_command:
          - code .
          - git status
  - window_name: frontend
    layout: even-vertical
    shell_command_before:
      - cd ~/Workspace/advanced-react/frontend
    panes:
      - shell_command:
          - npm run dev
      - shell_command:
          - code .
          - git status
```

You can then launch this session by typing `tmuxp load advanced-react` and you will get, in this case, a session called `advanced-react` with two windows, each containing 2 panes spread vertically, running _npm_ commands, opening _vscode_ and displaying _git status_.

Of course it is up to you to define your environments, depending on the kind of projects you are working on and how you like to organize things. The possibilities are endless!

## Final words

If it is the first time you have come across _tmux_, you might feel overwhelmed right now. In this article, I did my best to stick to what I really use and what saves me time in my everyday programming.

Take your time to understand how it works, and once you are comfortable with the basics, feel free to explore all the possibilities with _tmux_.

If you already are a _tmux_ user, I am curious to know the main functionalities that you find useful. I would be glad to hear about them in the comments.
